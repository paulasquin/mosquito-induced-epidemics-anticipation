# mosquito-induced-epidemics-anticipation
Use Machine Learning to recognise mosquito species from pictures and anticipate risk areas with geolocalised data.

# Introduction

This project is led by Robin Schowb and Paul Asquin form the french engineering school **CentraleSup√©lec**.  
This project is led autonomously and takes place in Machine Learning courses teached by Pr [Fragkiskos D. Malliaros](http://fragkiskos.me/).  

We will try to achieve two objective :  
  
**1. Use Convolutional Neural Networks to recognise mosquito species.**  
We will use pictures downloaded via Google and study the accuracy differences between Inception retraining and From Scratch Neural Networks.  
  
**2. Use Machine Learning models to anticipate if an area have risks to develop mosquito induced epidemics.**  
We will use Kaggle Datasets to achieve this objective :  
a. [Malarial Mosquito Database](https://www.kaggle.com/jboysen/malaria-mosquito/)
*Geo-coded Inventory of Anophelines in the Sub-Saharan Africa*  
b. [The fight against malaria](https://www.kaggle.com/teajay/the-fight-against-malaria)
*Who is dying and being saved from this destructive disease?*
